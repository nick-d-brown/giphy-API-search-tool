### 1-Description :page\_facing\_up:


This web app is a search tool that utilizes the GIPHY API to pull up 10 gifs that are related to the button that the user presses. On the web page, below the description, there is are preset buttons that access gifs related to things you might text your friend. Above these preset buttons there is also a section with an input box and submit button to create new buttons for the user to click. To "play" the gif, simply click on the image. Below each gif is the parental rating so the user doesn't accidentally click on a gif with questionable content. 

> **Note:** Below is an image of the landing page for the project.

### 3-Challenges :scream::boom:

> **Note:** This section is meant for beginners an idea of what the *crux* technology was for this project. Ideally by seeing this first they will be able tackle the hard problem first to start the learning/absorption process as soon as possible.

Throughout the creation of this web app, the main challenge that was encountered was determining the proper way to call the GIPHY API and to structure the base URL to call it using different keywords. After this was solved, the only other challenge was that of using a flag, and the data attribute, to switch between the still image and the .gif image. As of now all known issues have been resolved and the web app is functioning as intended. Use the links listed below to learn more about the technology and remember **you will eventually learn how everything works!**
